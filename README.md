# ZIP-DL

This repository contains the code for the paper "Low-Cost Privacy-Aware Decentralized Learning," available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11795.

Some code fragments have been omitted as they depend heavily on our original computing grid and use [enoslib](https://discovery.gitlabpages.inria.fr/enoslib/) scripts. These omitted parts handle deployment and saving simulation results, built on top of our `decentralizepy` fork.

## Repository Organization
* Simulations are conducted using the `decentralizepy` submodule.
* Privacy attacks are implemented in the `attack/` folder.
* Code for reorganizing `decentralizepy` simulation data and launching experiments is omitted due to its dependence on our computing architecture ([Grid5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home)). The full code is available [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/dilereve/decentralizepy_grid5000).
* Singularity images are used for [running simulations](compute_container.def) and [running attacks](attacker_container.def). The [Makefile](Makefile) builds these containers.
* Additional simulation code is available in `misc_simulations/`, including [code](misc_simulations/assumption_noisy_gradient.py) for Figures 13 and 14, which can be run independently as long as the environment is installed.

## Workflow Overview
Here is a brief overview about using our code: 
1. Simulate ZIP-DL using our fork of the `decentralizepy` library. Attackers save models for later attacks. To do so, users must generate a configuration file, distribute it across machines, and correctly set `ip.json`.
2. After the simulation, group results into a single folder if multiple machines were used.
3. Run attacks using the `attacker_container` and the `attacks` folder.
4. Format, visualize and store results using [`attacks/pets_plots.ipynb`](attacks/pets_plots.ipynb).

## Installation
Run `make` to build the Singularity images containing all necessary libraries.

For development or local execution, create a virtual environment. We tested with Python 3.10—Python 3.11 may cause conflicts with `sklearn`.

```sh
python3.10 -m venv venv-zip-dl
source venv-*/bin/activate
```

Then, install dependencies:

```sh
pip install --editable decentralizepy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experimental Pipeline
This pipeline produces the results in our paper in four steps:
1. **Simulating decentralized learning**.
2. **Reorganizing simulation results**.
3. **Running attacks**.
4. **Visualizing results**.

Each step is detailed below with relevant code references.

### 1 - Running Simulations
Simulations run using [decentralizepy](https://github.com/sacs-epfl/decentralizepy). Our fork includes:
* [`ZIP-DL`](decentralizepy/src/decentralizepy/sharing/ZeroSumSharing.py) (zerosum) and [`Muffliato`](decentralizepy/src/decentralizepy/sharing/Muffliato.py) as `Sharing` objects.
* Modified scripts to save models at specified intervals for downstream attacks.

To run a simulation, generate a configuration file with the desired parameters and deploy it accordingly.

### 2 - Organizing Simulation Results
Simulation results need to be structured as follows for attacks:
```
experiment_name/
    config.ini
    g5k_config.json
    machine1/
    ...
    machinek/
```
Key details:
* `machine*` folders are generated by `decentralizepy` and should be consolidated into one directory.
* `config.ini` contains the `decentralizepy` configuration used for the simulation.
* `g5k_config.json` stores additional simulation parameters not included in `config.ini`, such as the number of nodes.

### 3 - Running Attacks
Attacks use the `attacker_container.sif` container, which wraps [`perform_attacks.py`](attacks/perform_attacks.py). To use it:
* Bind the folder containing experiment data to `/experiments_to_attack` in the container.
* Provide necessary arguments for [`perform_attacks.py`](attacks/perform_attacks.py).

The `attacks/` structure includes:
* [`perform_attacks.py`](attacks/perform_attacks.py) — runs attacks on the given dataset.
* [`classifier_attacker.py`](attacks/classifier_attacker.py) — implements the attack logic.

### 4 - Visualizing Results
Results are analyzed in the `attacks` folder, mainly using [notebooks](attacks/pets_plots.ipynb). Supporting scripts include:
* `plot_loaders.py`
* `plot_results.py`
* `plot_utils.py`

Generated plots and stored CSV data were used to create the paper’s figures.

# Artifact Appendix

Paper title: **Low-Cost Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Learning**

Artifacts HotCRP Id: **9** (not your paper Id, but the artifacts id)

Requested Badge: **Available**

## Description
This artifact contains the code for simulations of the paper **Low-Cost Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Learning**. In particular, it contains the necessary code to:
* Run simulations corresponding to our algorithm
* Perform the attacks we use in our paper.
* Gather and aggregate the results to generate the data used in our paper.

Some chosen important code fragments for the paper are:
* Implementation of [algorithm 1](https://github.com/dimiarbre/decentralizepy/blob/082f945/src/decentralizepy/sharing/ZeroSumSharing.py#L16)
* Implementation of the [classifier attack](https://github.com/dimiarbre/ZIP-DL/blob/main/attacks/classifier_attacker.py#L583)
* Implementation of the [Loss attack](https://github.com/dimiarbre/ZIP-DL/blob/main/attacks/threshold_attacker.py#L44)

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (All badges)
This artifact does not hold any security or privacy risk. We use public datasets, and perform privacy attacks on models generated within our experiments.


## Environment 
In the following, describe how to access our artifact and all related and necessary data and software components.
Afterward, describe how to set up everything and how to verify that everything is set up correctly.

### Accessibility (All badges)
This artifact itself contains most of the source code, limited to what was used in the paper. As described above in this README, the full source code can nevertheless be found [at this link](https://gitlab.inria.fr/dilereve/decentralizepy_grid5000/-/tree/Popets_revision?ref_type=tags). However, this repository aims to be self-sufficient in terms of source code, with the only code missing being the experiment configuration generation and deployment scripts.

For the detailed organization of this repository, we refer to the above sections that describes the aim of each folder or code fragment.
